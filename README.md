# TDMA Based Scheduling 

An implementation of a TDMA based scheduling algorithm, which uses admission 
control for managing delay sensitive real time traffic. 

The algorithm is an interpretation of works on Real Time scheduling in Wireless Network
with few changes in algorithm. The first AP in the network get the most appropriate non blocking slot 
so all the uplink and downlink hops can have best scheduling probability.
